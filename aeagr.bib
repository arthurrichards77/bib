	of autonomous flights of an MAV in unknown environments, only having
	a monocular camera as exteroceptive sensor. As MAVs are highly agile,
	it is not sufficient to directly use the visual input for position
	control at the framerates that can be achieved with small onboard
	computers. Our contributions in this work are twofold. First, we
	present a solution to overcome the issue of having a low frequent
	onboard visual pose update versus the high agility of an MAV. This
	is solved by filtering visual information with inputs from inertial
	sensors. Second, as our system is based on monocular vision, we present
	a solution to estimate the metric visual scale aid of an air pressure
	sensor. All computation is running onboard and is tightly integrated
	on the MAV to avoid jitter and latencies. This framework enables
	stable flights indoors and outdoors even under windy conditions.},

	autonomous fixed-wing aerial vehicles performing large-scale maneuvers.
	The main result is a planner which designs nearly minimum time planar
	trajectories to a goal, constrained by no-fly zones and the vehicle's
	maximum speed and turning rate. MixedInteger Linear Programming (MILP)
	is used for the optimization, and is well suited to trajectory optimization
	because it can incorporate logical constraints, such as no-fly zone
	avoidance, and continuous constraints, such as aircraft dynamics.
	MILP is applied over a receding planning horizon to reduce the computational
	effort of the planner and to incorporate feedback. In this approach,
	MILP is used to plan short trajectories that extend towards the goal,
	but do not necessarily reach it. The cost function accounts for decisions
	beyond the planning horizon by estimating the time to reach the goal
	from the plan's end point. This time is estimated by searching a
	graph representation of the environment. This approach is shown to
	avoid entrapment behind obstacles, to yield near-optimal performance
	when comparison with the minimum arrival time found using a fixed
	horizon controller is possible, and to work consistently on large
	trajectory optimization problems that are intractable for the fixed
	horizon controller.},

	towards RGB-D video streams and explores the use of these and other
	edge features in RGB-D SLAM. The proposed depth edge-detection approach
	uses prior information obtained from the previous RGB-D video frame
	to determine which areas of the current depth image are likely to
	contain edges due to image similarity. By limiting the search for
	edges to these areas a significant amount of computation time is
	saved compared to searching the entire image. Pixels belonging to
	both the depth and colour edges of an RGB-D image can be back projected
	using the depth component to form 3D point clouds of edge points.
	Registration between such edge point clouds is achieved using ICP
	and we present a real-time RGB-D SLAM system utilizing such back
	projected edge features. Experimental results are presented demonstrating
	the performance of both the proposed depth edge-detection and SLAM
	system using publicly available datasets.},

	interesting opportunity in the development of algorithms to solve
	mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). We propose a framework using
	multiple branch-and-bound trees to solve \{MILPs\} while allowing
	them to share information in a parallel execution. We present computational
	results on instances from \{MIPLIB\} 2010 illustrating the benefits
	of this framework. },

  abstract = {Adaptive navigation is a novel combination of receding horizon control
	and simultaneous locating and mapping. Experience has shown the initial
	implementation of adaptive navigation to be computationally expensive,
	due to the large size of the path planner's optimisation problem,
	as well as node to cell visibility checking. Successful avoidance
	of walls and other obstacles requires the ability to avoid known
	obstacles at the path planning stage, beside preventing the path
	from leading into areas with yet undetected obstacles. This paper
	presents two new approaches to achieving wall avoidance behaviour
	in the trajectory planner, which substantially reduce the size of
	the optimisation problem and improve path planning speed. Furthermore,
	a new strategy of path planning node placement is introduced, which
	signicantly reduces computation by dispensing with exhaustive visibility
	checking. The new approaches show a marked improvement in computation
	time when compared to the initial implementation, as well as improved
	success rates.},

	winds. Optimal trajectories for minimal and maximal wind conditions
	are generated as well as trajectories for optimal cross-country travel.
	The flight model?s differential flatness property is used to simplify
	the optimisation problem. The likelihood of favourable winds is predicted
	based on long term weather statistics and knowledge of the minimal
	and maximal permissible wind strength. Comparison of the likelihood
	of favourable winds for the wandering albatross and a UAV of similar
	size shows that the ability to fly close to the surface is a key
	factor governing dynamic soaring performance.},

	such, this mission represents an essential step towards a new space

	spacecraft in a tight, closely-spaced formation. The mission will
	use carrier-phase differential GPS (CDGPS) as the primary relative
	navigation sensor. Algorithms for fuel optimization and formation
	planning have also been developed and these will be executed onboard.
	Because of the poor visibility available to ground stations, the

	they enable stealthy use of active sensing for safe terrain avoidance.
	The paper identifies an efficient method for calculating the volumes
	and provides illustrative results of their shapes. Furthermore, the
	approach is adapted to account for non-instantaneous scanning, providing
	a practical sensing strategy. Again, simulations illustrate that
	a specified warning time is ensured.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of a model predictive
	control (MPC) system to guide and control a chasing spacecraft during
	rendezvous with a passive target spacecraft in an elliptical or circular
	orbit, from the point of target detection all the way to capture.
	To achieve an efficient system design, the rendezvous manoeuvre has
	been partitioned into three main phases based on the range of operation,
	plus a collision-avoidance manoeuvre to be used in event of a fault.
	Each has its own associated MPC controller. Linear time-varying models
	are used to enable trajectory predictions in elliptical orbits, whilst
	a variable prediction horizon is used to achieve finite-time completion
	of manoeuvres, and a 1-norm cost on velocity change minimises propellant
	consumption. Constraints are imposed to ensure that trajectories
	do not collide with the target. A key feature of the design is the
	implementation of non-convex constraints as switched convex constraints,
	enabling the use of convex linear and quadratic programming. The
	system is implemented using commercial-off-the-shelf tools with deployment
	using automatic code generation in mind, and validated by closed-loop
	simulation. A significant reduction in total propellant consumption
	in comparison with a baseline benchmark solution is observed.},

	(RRT) have been recently proposed as an effective approach to computationally
	hard motion planning problem. However, while the RRT algorithm is
	known to be able to find a feasible solution quickly, there are no
	guarantees on the quality of such solution, e.g., with respect to
	a given cost functional. To address this limitation, the authors
	recently proposed a new algorithm, called RRT*, which ensures asymptotic
	optimality, i.e., almost sure convergence of the solution returned
	by the algorithm to an optimal solution, while maintaining the same
	properties of the standard RRT algorithm, both in terms of computation
	of feasible solutions, and of computational complexity. In this paper,
	the RRT* algorithm is extended to deal with differential constraints.
	A sufficient condition for asymptotic optimality is provided. It
	is shown that the RRT* algorithm equipped with any local steering
	procedure that satisfies this condition converges to an optimal solution
	almost surely. In particular, simple local steering procedures are
	provided for a Dubins' vehicle as well as a double integrator. Simulation
	examples are also provided for these systems comparing the RRT and
	the RRT* algorithms.},

	is the result of three key enhancements. First, the terrain representation
	is reformulated as a piecewise affine function, resulting in a better
	conditioned MILP problem. Second, an efficient method of approximating
	and simplifying real terrain data is developed. Finally, an iterative
	MILP solution approach is adopted, reducing computational effort
	by avoiding the application of redundant constraints. The new method
	is shown to offer significant reductions in solution time for only
	small loss of performance in terms of the planning objective.},

	savings against solo flight of around 8.7% for formations of two

	algorithm for multi-vehicle trajectory optimization and demonstrates
	the approach with numerical simulations and multi-vehicle experiments.
	The technique builds on the robust-safe-but-knowledgeable (RSBK)
	algorithm, which is developed in this paper for the multi-vehicle
	case. RSBK uses constraint tightening to achieve robustness to external
	disturbances, an invariant set to ensure safety in the presence of
	changes to the environment, and a cost-to-go function to generate
	an intelligent trajectory around known obstacles. The key advantage
	of this RSBK algorithm is that it enables the use of much shorter
	planning horizons while still preserving the robust feasibility guarantees
	of previously proposed approaches. The second contribution of this
	paper is a distributed version of the RSBK algorithm, which is more
	suitable for real-time execution. In the distributed RSBK (DRSBK)
	algorithm, each vehicle only optimizes for its own decisions by solving
	a subproblem of reduced size, which results in shorter computation
	times. Furthermore, the algorithm retains the robust feasibility
	guarantees of the centralized approach while requiring that each
	agent only have local knowledge of the environment and neighbor vehicles?

	for Lyapunov asymptotic stability and exponential stability are derived

	discontinuous system dynamics and discontinuous MPC value functions.
	For constrained piecewise affine (PWA) systems as prediction models,
	we present novel techniques for computing a terminal cost and a terminal
	constraint set that satisfy the developed stabilization conditions.
	For quadratic MPC costs, these conditions translate into a linear
	matrix inequality while, for MPC costs based on 1, infin-norms, they
	are obtained as norm inequalities. New ways for calculating low complexity
	piecewise polyhedral positively invariant sets for PWA systems are
	also presented. An example illustrates the developed theory},

	moved asynchronously. This contrasts with most MIMO control schemes,
	which assume that all variables are updated simultaneously. MPC outperforms
	other control strategies through its ability to deal with constraints.
	This requires on-line optimization, hence computational complexity
	can become an issue when applying MPC to complex systems with fast
	response times. The Multiplexed MPC (MMPC) scheme described in this
	paper solves the MPC problem for each subsystem sequentially, and
	updates subsystem controls as soon as the solution is available,
	thus distributing the control moves over a complete update cycle.
	The resulting computational speed-up allows faster response to disturbances,
	which may result in improved performance, despite finding sub-optimal
	solutions to the original problem. This paper describes nominal and
	robust MMPC, states some stability results, and demonstrates the
	effectiveness of MMPC through two examples.},

  abstract = {Abstract Autonomous navigation of a robot is a promising research
	domain due to its extensive applications. The navigation consists
	of four essential requirements known as perception, localization,
	cognition and path planning, and motion control in which path planning
	is the most important and interesting part. The proposed path planning
	techniques are classified into two main categories: classical methods
	and heuristic methods. The classical methods consist of cell decomposition,
	potential field method, subgoal network and road map. The approaches
	are simple; however, they commonly consume expensive computation
	and may possibly fail when the robot confronts with uncertainty.
	This survey concentrates on heuristic-based algorithms in robot path
	planning which are comprised of neural network, fuzzy logic, nature-inspired
	algorithms and hybrid algorithms. In addition, potential field method
	is also considered due to the good results. The strengths and drawbacks
	of each algorithm are discussed and future outline is provided. },

  abstract = {This paper presents an alternative approach to the problem of outdoor,
	persistent visual localisation against a known map. Instead of blindly
	applying a feature detector/descriptor combination over all images
	of all places, we leverage prior experiences of a place to learn
	place-dependent feature detectors (i.e., features that are unique
	to each place in our map and used for localisation). Furthermore,
	as these features do not represent low-level structure, like edges
	or corners, but are in fact mid-level patches representing distinctive
	visual elements (e.g., windows, buildings, or silhouettes), we are
	able to localise across extreme appearance changes. Note that there
	is no requirement that the features posses semantic meaning, only
	that they are optimal for the task of localisation. This work is
	an extension on previous work (McManus et al. in Proceedings of robotics
	science and systems, 2014b) in the following ways: (i) we have included
	a landmark refinement and outlier rejection step during the learning
	phase, (ii) we have implemented an asynchronous pipeline design,
	(iii) we have tested on data collected in an urban environment, and
	(iv) we have implemented a purely monocular system. Using over 100km
	worth of data for training, we present localisation results from
	Begbroke Science Park and central Oxford.},

	The system is assumed to be constant, and the random inputs are stationary.
	First, a correlation test is given which checks whether a particular
	Kalman filter is working optimally or not. If the filter is suboptimal,
	a technique is given to obtain asymptotically normal, unbiased, and
	consistent estimates ofQandR. This technique works only for the case

	inQis less thann times rwherenis the dimension of the state vector
	andris the dimension of the measurement vector. For other cases,
	the optimal steady-state gain Kopis obtained directly by an iterative
	procedure without identifyingQ. As a corollary, it is shown that
	the steady-state optimal Kalman filter gain Kopdepends only onn times
	rlinear functionals ofQ. The results are first derived for discrete
	systems. They are then extended to continuous systems. A numerical
	example is given to show the usefulness of the approach.},

	learning algorithm generates an adaptive approximation based on measurements
	of the 3D positions of static points in the environment, obtained
	via feature point tracking and structure from motion. A receding
	horizon path planning strategy is used to select a series of locally-optimal
	path points in front of the vehicle. These path points are selected
	in such a manner that the vehicle approaches an overall target point
	while avoiding static obstacles that may lie in its path. These obstacles
	are estimated via the adaptive learning algorithm, which provides
	constraints for the path planner. A standard waypoint controller
	is then used to fly the vehicle through the selected path points.
	This vision-based control strategy is demonstrated in simulations
	of a small UAV flying through a virtual urban environment},

  abstract = {This thesis extends Model Predictive Control (MPC) for constrained
	linear systems subject to uncertainty, including persistent disturbances,
	estimation error and the effects of delay. Previous work has shown
	that feasibility and constraint satisfaction can be guaranteed by
	tightening the constraints in a suitable, monotonic sequence. This
	thesis extends that work in several ways, including more flexible
	constraint tightening, applied within the prediction horizon, and
	more general terminal constraints, applied to ensure feasible evolution
	beyond the horizon. These modifications reduce the conservatism associated
	with the constraint tightening approach. Modifications to account
	for estimation error, enabling output feedback control, are presented,
	and we show that the effects of time delay can be handled in a similar
	manner. A further extension combines robust MPC with a novel uncertainty
	estimation algorithm, providing an adaptive MPC that adjusts the
	optimization constraints to suit the level of uncertainty detected.
	This adaptive control replaces the need for accurate \emph{a~priori}
	knowledge of uncertainty bounds. An approximate algorithm is developed
	for the prediction of the closed-loop performance using the new robust
	MPC formulation, enabling rapid trade studies on the effect of controller
	parameters. The constraint tightening concept is applied to develop
	a novel algorithm for Decentralized MPC~(DMPC) for teams of cooperating
	subsystems with coupled constraints. The centralized MPC optimization
	is divided into smaller subproblems, each solving for the future
	actions of a single subsystem. Each subproblem is solved only once
	per time step, without iteration, and is guaranteed to be feasible.
	Simulation examples involving multiple Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles~({UAV}s)
	demonstrate that the new DMPC algorithm offers significant computational
	improvement compared to its centralized counterpart. The controllers
	developed in this thesis are demonstrated throughout in simulated
	examples related to vehicle control. Also, some of the controllers
	have been implemented on vehicle testbeds to verify their operation.
	The tools developed in this thesis improve the applicability of MPC
	to problems involving uncertainty and high complexity, for example,
	the control of a team of cooperating {UAV}s.},

	such as assignment of waypoints to {UAV}s and the assignment of spacecraft
	to positions in a formation. These requirements lead to non-convex
	constraints and difficult optimizations. However, they can be formulated
	as \emph{mixed-integer linear programs} (MILP) that can be solved
	for global optimality using powerful, commercial software. This thesis
	provides several extensions to previous work using MILP. The constraints
	for avoidance are extended to prevent \emph{plume impingement}, which
	occurs when one spacecraft fire thrusters towards another. Methods
	are presented for efficient simplifications to complex problems,
	allowing solutions to be obtained in practical computation times.
	An approximation is developed to enable the inclusion of aircraft
	dynamics in a linear optimization, and also to include a general
	form of waypoint assignment suitable for {UAV} problems. Finally,
	these optimizations are used in \emph{model predictive control},
	running in real-time to incorporate feedback and compensate for uncertainty.
	Two major application areas are considered: spacecraft and aircraft.
	Spacecraft problems involve minimum fuel optimizations, and include
	ISS rendezvous and satellite cluster configuration. Aircraft problems
	are solved for minimum flight-time, or in the case of {UAV} problems
	with assignment, waypoint values and vehicle capabilities are included.
	Aircraft applications include air traffic management and coordination
	of autonomous {UAV}s. The results in this thesis provide a direct
	route to globally-optimal solutions of these non-convex trajectory
	optimizations.},

	gains more and more importance in robotics, as well as other fields.
	In this paper we present one of our most recent initiatives in the
	areas of point cloud perception: PCL (Point Cloud Library - http://pointclouds.org).
	PCL presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of
	3D perception, and it's meant to provide support for all the common
	3D building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of-the
	art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction,
	registration, model fitting and segmentation. PCL is supported by
	an international community of robotics and perception researchers.
	We provide a brief walkthrough of PCL including its algorithmic capabilities
	and implementation strategies.},

	control algorithms in a real-time environment is introduced. A Cloned
	Controller is demonstrated using Linguistic Decision Trees (LDTs)
	to clone a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) based on Mixed Integer
	Linear Programming (MILP) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path
	planning through a hostile environment. Modifications to the \{LDT\}
	algorithm are proposed to account for attributes with circular domains,
	such as bearings, and discontinuous output functions. The cloned
	controller is shown to produce near optimal paths whilst significantly
	reducing the decision period. Further investigation shows that the
	cloned controller generalises to the multi-obstacle case although
	this can lead to situations far outside of the training dataset and
	consequently result in decisions with a high level of uncertainty.
	A modification to the algorithm to improve the performance in regions
	of high uncertainty is proposed and shown to further enhance generalisation.
	The resulting controller combines the high performance of MPC?MILP
	with the rapid response of an \{LDT\} while providing a degree of
	transparency/interpretability of the decision making.},

  abstract = {The article presents a random neural Q-learning strategy for the obstacle
	avoidance problem of an autonomous mobile robot in unknown environments.
	In the proposed strategy, two independent modules, namely, avoidance
	without considering the target and goal-seeking without considering
	obstacles, are first trained using the proposed random neural Q-learning
	algorithm to obtain their best control policies. Then, the two trained
	modules are combined based on a switching function to realize the
	obstacle avoidance in unknown environments. For the proposed random
	neural Q-learning algorithm, a single-hidden layer feedforward network
	is used to approximate the Q-function to estimate the Q-value. The
	parameters of the single-hidden layer feedforward network are modified
	using the recently proposed neural algorithm named the online sequential
	version of extreme learning machine, where the parameters of the
	hidden nodes are assigned randomly and the sample data can come one
	by one. However, different from the original online sequential version
	of extreme learning machine algorithm, the initial output weights
	are estimated subjected to quadratic inequality constraint to improve
	the convergence speed. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate
	that the proposed random neural Q-learning strategy can successfully
	solve the obstacle avoidance problem. Also, the higher learning efficiency
	and better generalization ability are achieved by the proposed random
	neural Q-learning algorithm compared with the Q-learning based on
	the back-propagation method.},
