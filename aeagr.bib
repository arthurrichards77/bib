  Abstract                 = {Social laws have proved to be a powerful and theoretically elegant framework for coordination
in multi-agent systems. Most existing models of social laws assume that a designer
is attempting to produce a set of constraints on agent behaviour which will ensure
that some single overall desirable objective is achieved. However, this represents
a gross simplification of the typical situation, where a designer may have multiple
(possibly conflicting) objectives, with different priorities. Moreover, social laws,
as well as bringing benefits, also have implementation costs: imposing a social law
often cannot be done at zero cost. We present a model of social laws that reflects
this reality: it takes into account both the fact that the designer of a social law
may have multiple differently valued objectives, and that the implementation of a
social law is not costneutral. In this setting, designing a social law becomes an
optimisation problem, in which a designer must take into account both the benefits
and costs of a social law. We investigate the issue of representing a designer's objectives,
characterise the complexity of the optimal social law design problem, and consider
possible constraints that lead to reductions in computational complexity. We then
show how the problem of designing an optimal social law can be formulated as an integer
linear program.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present our latest achievements towards the goal of autonomous flights of an MAV in unknown environments, only having a monocular camera as exteroceptive sensor. As MAVs are highly agile, it is not sufficient to directly use the visual input for position control at the framerates that can be achieved with small onboard computers. Our contributions in this work are twofold. First, we present a solution to overcome the issue of having a low frequent onboard visual pose update versus the high agility of an MAV. This is solved by filtering visual information with inputs from inertial sensors. Second, as our system is based on monocular vision, we present a solution to estimate the metric visual scale aid of an air pressure sensor. All computation is running onboard and is tightly integrated on the MAV to avoid jitter and latencies. This framework enables stable flights indoors and outdoors even under windy conditions.},

Since there are many types of displays and controls already in existence, an overview is presented in this chapter to assist the practicing ergonomist in the selection of displays and controls. Important distinctions are made between quantitative and qualitative displays as well as discrete and continuous controls. Population stereotypes are also discussed as they affect the design of displays and controls.},

  Abstract                 = {RGB-D cameras provide both color images and per-pixel depth estimates. The richness of this data and the recent development of low-cost sensors have combined to present an attractive opportunity for mobile robotics research. In this paper, we describe a system for visual odometry and mapping using an RGB-D camera, and its application to autonomous flight. By leveraging results from recent state-of-the-art algorithms and hardware, our system enables 3D flight in cluttered environments using only onboard sensor data. All computation and sensing required for local position control are performed onboard the vehicle, reducing the dependence on an unreliable wireless link to a ground station. However, even with accurate 3D sensing and position estimation, some parts of the environment have more perceptual structure than others, leading to state estimates that vary in accuracy across the environment. If the vehicle plans a path without regard to how well it can localize itself along that path, it runs the risk of becoming lost or worse. We show how the belief roadmap algorithm prentice2009belief, a belief space extension of the probabilistic roadmap algorithm, can be used to plan vehicle trajectories that incorporate the sensing model of the RGB-D camera. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system for controlling a quadrotor micro air vehicle, demonstrate its use for constructing detailed 3D maps of an indoor environment, and discuss its limitations.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents results on the guidance and control of fleets of cooperating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ({UAV}s). A key challenge for these systems is to develop an overall control system architecture that can perform optimal coordination of the fleet, evaluate the overall fleet performance in real-time, and quickly reconfigure to account for changes in the environment or the fleet. The optimal fleet coordination problem includes team composition and goal assignment, resource allocation, and trajectory optimization. These are complicated optimization problems for scenarios with many vehicles, obstacles, and targets. Furthermore, these problems are strongly coupled, and optimal coordination plans cannot be achieved if this coupling is ignored. This paper presents an approach to the combined resource allocation and trajectory optimization aspects of the fleet coordination problem which calculates and communicates the key information that couples the two. Also, this approach permits some steps to be distributed between parallel processing platforms for faster solution. This algorithm estimates the cost of various trajectory options using the distributed platforms and then solves a centralized assignment problem to minimize the mission completion time. The detailed trajectory planning for this assignment can then be distributed back to the platforms. During execution, the coordination and control system reacts to changes in the fleet or the environment. The overall approach is demonstrated on several example scenarios to show multi-task allocation and cooperative path planning prior to the mission and to show dynamic re-planning to account for changes in the environment during execution.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new approach to trajectory optimization for autonomous fixed-wing aerial vehicles performing large-scale maneuvers. The main result is a planner which designs nearly minimum time planar trajectories to a goal, constrained by no-fly zones and the vehicle's maximum speed and turning rate. MixedInteger Linear Programming (MILP) is used for the optimization, and is well suited to trajectory optimization because it can incorporate logical constraints, such as no-fly zone avoidance, and continuous constraints, such as aircraft dynamics. MILP is applied over a receding planning horizon to reduce the computational effort of the planner and to incorporate feedback. In this approach, MILP is used to plan short trajectories that extend towards the goal, but do not necessarily reach it. The cost function accounts for decisions beyond the planning horizon by estimating the time to reach the goal from the plan's end point. This time is estimated by searching a graph representation of the environment. This approach is shown to avoid entrapment behind obstacles, to yield near-optimal performance when comparison with the minimum arrival time found using a fixed horizon controller is possible, and to work consistently on large trajectory optimization problems that are intractable for the fixed horizon controller.},

  Abstract                 = {System assurance is confronted by significant challenges. Some of these are new, for example, autonomous systems with major functions driven by machine learning and AI, and ultra-rapid system development, while others are the familiar, persistent issues of the need for efficient, effective and timely assurance. Traditional assurance is seen as a brake on innovation and often costly and time consuming. We therefore propose a modernized framework, Assurance 2.0, as an enabler that supports innovation and continuous incremental assurance. Perhaps unexpectedly, it does so by making assurance more rigorous, with increased focus on the reasoning and evidence employed, and explicit identification of defeaters and counterevidence.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a method of occluding depth edge-detection targeted towards RGB-D video streams and explores the use of these and other edge features in RGB-D SLAM. The proposed depth edge-detection approach uses prior information obtained from the previous RGB-D video frame to determine which areas of the current depth image are likely to contain edges due to image similarity. By limiting the search for edges to these areas a significant amount of computation time is saved compared to searching the entire image. Pixels belonging to both the depth and colour edges of an RGB-D image can be back projected using the depth component to form 3D point clouds of edge points. Registration between such edge point clouds is achieved using ICP and we present a real-time RGB-D SLAM system utilizing such back projected edge features. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the performance of both the proposed depth edge-detection and SLAM system using publicly available datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper extends previous analysis on the impact of sensing noise upon the control aspects of formation flying spacecraft. We present a method of predicting the performance of the closed-loop system in the presence of sensing noise and demonstrate its effectiveness for the spacecraft relative motion problem. Its performance predictions are verified through simulation and used to analyze the effects of formation flying mission parameter trades without recourse to extensive numerical simulation. Ideal values for several model predictive control parameters are identified.},

An iterative method is used to reduce the computational demand of the required separation constraints whilst introducing no loss in performance. A Receding Horizon (RH) approach is added to further reduce the solution times. As well as faster solve times, RH enables the computation to be spread between horizons preventing detailed plans being calculated for the distant future. RH is an approximation to the globally optimal solution, but still shown to improve upon a First Come First Serve (FCFS) approach, by 56% when comparing the total taxi time and 9% when comparing runway throughput.},

  Comment                  = {Section II: At its most simple, autonomy denotes self-government. In this basic sense, it is not so much a normative concept as an empirical question: we do not know ex ante that (or how much) autonomy is good. Rather we ask whether autonomy exists in any situation: is a person directing her action? If yes, she is being autonomous, if no, she is not. This does not tell us that she should be self-governing. Whether it is good that people govern themselves, or to what extent they should do so, are many-layered questions. Differing problems present themselves. For example, there are concerns about what authority the �self� in a self-governor has: is a young child capable of autonomy, or is she too ignorant and irrational meaningfully to self-govern? Is being autonomous an absolute matter, meaning either one is or is not autonomous, or is it graded or context-specific, meaning one can be more or less autonomous?},

  Abstract                 = {Conflicting interests among group members are common when making collective decisions, yet failure to achieve consensus can be costly. Under these circumstances individuals may be susceptible to manipulation by a strongly opinionated, or extremist, minority. It has previously been argued, for humans and animals, that social groups containing individuals who are uninformed, or exhibit weak preferences, are particularly vulnerable to such manipulative agents. Here, we use theory and experiment to demonstrate that, for a wide range of conditions, a strongly opinionated minority can dictate group choice, but the presence of uninformed individuals spontaneously inhibits this process, returning control to the numerical majority. Our results emphasize the role of uninformed individuals in achieving democratic consensus amid internal group conflict and informational constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {Control systems on unmanned vehicles are safety-critical systems whose requirements on reliability and safety are ever-increasing. Currently, testing a complex autonomous control system is an expensive and time-consuming process, which requires massive repeated experimental testing during the whole development stage. This paper presents a unified simulation and test platform for vehicle autonomous control systems aiming to significantly improve the development speed and safety level of unmanned vehicles. First, a unified modular modeling framework compatible with different types of vehicles is proposed with methods to ensure modeling credibility. Then, the simulation software system is developed by the model-based design framework, whose modular programming methods and automatic code generation functions ensure the efficiency, credibility, and standardization of the system development process. Finally, an FPGA-based real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform is proposed to ensure the comprehensiveness and credibility of the simulation and test results. In the end, the proposed platform is applied to a multicopter control system. By comparing with experimental results, the accuracy and credibility of the simulation testing results are verified by using the simulation credibility assessment method proposed in our previous work. To verify the practicability of the proposed platform, several successful applications are presented for the multicopter rapid prototyping, estimation algorithm verification, autonomous flight testing, and automatic safety testing with automatic fault injection and result evaluation of unmanned vehicles.},

  Abstract                 = {Adaptive navigation is a novel combination of receding horizon control and simultaneous locating and mapping. Experience has shown the initial implementation of adaptive navigation to be computationally expensive, due to the large size of the path planner's optimisation problem, as well as node to cell visibility checking. Successful avoidance of walls and other obstacles requires the ability to avoid known obstacles at the path planning stage, beside preventing the path from leading into areas with yet undetected obstacles. This paper presents two new approaches to achieving wall avoidance behaviour in the trajectory planner, which substantially reduce the size of the optimisation problem and improve path planning speed. Furthermore, a new strategy of path planning node placement is introduced, which signicantly reduces computation by dispensing with exhaustive visibility checking. The new approaches show a marked improvement in computation time when compared to the initial implementation, as well as improved success rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic soaring is a flight technique which extracts energy from wind gradients with the potential to power small UAVs in maritime applications. Wind gradients of the required magnitude naturally occur at the air-sea interface due to friction between the waves and the moving air. Suitability of dynamic soaring as a means of propulsion requires clarification of the achievable flight performance and the likelihood of favourable winds. Optimal trajectories for minimal and maximal wind conditions are generated as well as trajectories for optimal cross-country travel. The flight model?s differential flatness property is used to simplify the optimisation problem. The likelihood of favourable winds is predicted based on long term weather statistics and knowledge of the minimal and maximal permissible wind strength. Comparison of the likelihood of favourable winds for the wandering albatross and a UAV of similar size shows that the ability to fly close to the surface is a key factor governing dynamic soaring performance.},

The aim is to combine dynamic path planning with the ability to learn about the environment. The vehicle is tasked with autonomous travel from an uncertain initial position to an uncertain target, without prior mapping information. The environment is modelled using linear segments that represent boundaries between the estimated traversable and nontraversable regions. The approach integrates Receding Horizon Control (RHC) and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). The control problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and explicitly includes the obstacles and vehicle dynamics.We present the results of our experiments using Pioneer robots, as well as, simulation results which clearly demonstrated the impact of each component of the system.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic soaring is an engineless flight technique which extracts energy from wind gradients and has potential to enable long duration flight for small UAVs. For this paper, the authors investigate how atmospheric turbulence affects the dynamic soaring flight of a generic 3 meter wing span UAV. A previous publication established outer bounds of 7.6 m/s and 32 m/s on the range of feasible wind speed while assuming perfect control. The authors propose a periodic LQR to reject disturbances arising from atmospheric turbulence and modeling errors. Simulations with atmospheric turbulence, investigate feasibility of controlled dynamic soaring flight for wind speeds between 8 m/s and 24 m/s. Comparison between engineless and engine assisted dynamic soaring flight illustrates the importance of controlling the UAV?s energy in contrast to focusing on rejecting trajectory errors.},

Various methods have been developed and implemented in a large number of applications. Despite the rapid progress in the field the last few years, computation remains a significant issue of the methods employed. In this work, we have implemented two different strategies for inferring depth, both of which are computationally efficient. The first one is inspired by biology, that is optical flow, while the second one is based on a least squares method. In the first strategy, we observe the length variation of the optic flow vectors of a landmark at varying distances and velocities. In the second strategy, we take snapshots of a landmark from different positions and use a least squares approach to estimate the distance between the robot and a landmark. An evaluation of the two different strategies for various depth estimations has been deployed and the results are presented in this paper.},

The key property of the method is that it provides globally optimal solutions to these non-convex problems while retaining the full nonlinear dynamics model. Applications for the new algorithm include the guidance of Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles, air traffic control, and path-planning for robots. The core concept is the <i>direct</i> application of branch-and-bound optimisation, tailored to suit avoidance problems by exploiting two new ideas: first, using a geometric branching strategy based on the decision of whether to pass an obstacle on the left or on the right; and second, solving the resulting subproblems by constructing simple solutions on each chosen "side'' and using them as the initial guesses for primal-dual optimisation techniques. Examples are provided to illustrate the branch-and-bound procedure and show successful determination of optimal paths. A comparison between the initial implementation of the method and an existing Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach is also presented. The results of the solve time comparison indicate in the majority of cases the proposed method was faster than the MILP approach.},

The method tailors the branch-and-bound approach specifically for avoidance problems by exploiting two new ideas: first, using a geometric branching strategy based on the decision between passing an obstacle clockwise or counterclockwise; and second, solving the resulting optimization. The algorithm is refined by comparing nine geometric branching strategies. The solution time of the method depends on the choice of branching strategy, which determines how the solution tree is explored. A good branching strategy is one requiring fewer tree branches to be enumerated before the global optimal is found. The best of these branching strategies has been compared with an existing mixed-integer linear programming approach and demonstrated a significant improvement on mixed-integer linear programming solve times.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a novel method for finding optimal trajectories for vehicles constrained to avoid one another. The key property of the method is that it provides globally optimal solutions while retaining the full nonlinear dynamics model. Applications for the method include guidance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), air traffic control, and robot path planning. The core concept is the direct application of branch-and-bound optimisation, to find guaranteed, globally-optimal solutions to non-convex problems. This extends the work using nonlinear branch-and-bound optimiation for static obstacle avoidance where significant solve time savings were found against a conventional Mixed-Integer- Linear-Programming (MILP) approach. The proposed method uses the branch-and-bound approach for multi-vehicle avoidance problems by first, using a geometric branching strategy based on the decision for a pair of vehicles to pass one another clockwise or anticlockwise; and second, solving the resulting subproblems by constructing solutions on each chosen ?side? and using them to initialise an interior point optimisation. Two alternative methods of constructing initial solutions for initialising the interior point optimisation are proposed and compared. Both methods are then compared to existing Potential Fields and MILP methods demonstrating a significant improvement on MILP solve times for problems with four or more vehicles.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops and compares nine geometric branching strategies for use with a nonlinear branch and bound optimisation method, tailored for finding optimal trajectories for a vehicle constrained to avoid fixed obstacles. The key property of the branch and bound optimisation is that it provides globally optimal solutions to the nonconvex pathplanning problems whilst retaining the full nonlinear dynamics model. The solution time depends heavily on the choice of branching strategy, which determines how the solution tree is explored. A good strategy is one that requires fewer tree branches to be enumerated before the global optimal is found and verified. The branching strategies presented can be thought of as two linked decisions: which subproblem to add to the currently active node set; and which node within the currently active node set to next solve. The branch and bound approach used by obstacle branch and bound ensures all branching is geometric in nature and based on the decision of whether to pass an obstacle on the left or on the right, therefore allowing branching strategies to capitalise on direct understanding of the problem. A comparison of the nine branching strategies developed is presented and the best strategy is identified. The best strategy found was 30% faster than the first attempt strategy that had been previously implemented, indicating the importance of strategy choice. In addition, the best of these branching strategies is then compared with an existing Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach and demonstrated a significant improvement on MILP solve times, larger than previously observed.},

We present an online and decentralised coordination mechanism, based on the max-sum algorithm, to address this problem. In doing so, we introduce a novel coordination technique to the field of robotic search, and we extend the max-sum algorithm beyond the much simpler coordination problems to which it has been applied to date. Within a simulation environment, we benchmarked our max-sum algorithm against three other existing approaches for coordinating UAVs. The results showed that coordination with the max sum algorithm out-performed a best response algorithm, which represents the state of the art in the coordination of UAVs for search, by up to 26\%. The results further showed that the max-sum algorithm out-performed an implicitly coordinated approach, where the coordination arises from the agents making decisions based on a common belief, by up to 34\% and finally a non-coordinated approach by up to 68\%.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an update on the Orion-Emerald mission. This mission has been designed to demonstrate several key technologies required for formation flying, which is an important component of many planned space missions, including space-based radar and interferometry. As such, this mission represents an essential step towards a new space mission paradigm in which a "virtual spacecraft bus" is created using several smaller spacecraft. This new approach should provide improved science, enhanced reliability, and reduced mission cost. The primary goal of the Orion-Emerald mission is to demonstrate solutions to the relative navigation and control problems associated with flying spacecraft in a tight, closely-spaced formation. The mission will use carrier-phase differential GPS (CDGPS) as the primary relative navigation sensor. Algorithms for fuel optimization and formation planning have also been developed and these will be executed onboard. Because of the poor visibility available to ground stations, the entire navigation and control system is being designed to function autonomously on-orbit. This paper provides an update on the status of the vehicle and software developments for this very challenging microsatellite mission.},

  Abstract                 = {The minimum volume required to be scanned by a helicopter in order to provide a known amount of warning time before potential collisions with static terrain is identified. These volumes are useful because they enable stealthy use of active sensing for safe terrain avoidance. The paper identifies an efficient method for calculating the volumes and provides illustrative results of their shapes. Furthermore, the approach is adapted to account for non-instantaneous scanning, providing a practical sensing strategy. Again, simulations illustrate that a specified warning time is ensured.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the design and implementation of a model predictive control (MPC) system to guide and control a chasing spacecraft during rendezvous with a passive target spacecraft in an elliptical or circular orbit, from the point of target detection all the way to capture. To achieve an efficient system design, the rendezvous manoeuvre has been partitioned into three main phases based on the range of operation, plus a collision-avoidance manoeuvre to be used in event of a fault. Each has its own associated MPC controller. Linear time-varying models are used to enable trajectory predictions in elliptical orbits, whilst a variable prediction horizon is used to achieve finite-time completion of manoeuvres, and a 1-norm cost on velocity change minimises propellant consumption. Constraints are imposed to ensure that trajectories do not collide with the target. A key feature of the design is the implementation of non-convex constraints as switched convex constraints, enabling the use of convex linear and quadratic programming. The system is implemented using commercial-off-the-shelf tools with deployment using automatic code generation in mind, and validated by closed-loop simulation. A significant reduction in total propellant consumption in comparison with a baseline benchmark solution is observed.},

  Abstract                 = {Controllers for swarms of robots are hard to design as swarm behaviour emerges from their interaction, and so controllers are often evolved. However, these evolved controllers are often difficult to understand, limiting our ability to predict swarm behaviour. We suggest behaviour trees are a good control architecture for swarm robotics, as they are comprehensible and promote modular reuse. We design a foraging task for kilobots and evolve a behaviour tree capable of performing that task, both in simulation and reality, and show the controller is compact and under- standable.},

  Abstract                 = {Sampling-based algorithms such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) have been recently proposed as an effective approach to computationally hard motion planning problem. However, while the RRT algorithm is known to be able to find a feasible solution quickly, there are no guarantees on the quality of such solution, e.g., with respect to a given cost functional. To address this limitation, the authors recently proposed a new algorithm, called RRT*, which ensures asymptotic optimality, i.e., almost sure convergence of the solution returned by the algorithm to an optimal solution, while maintaining the same properties of the standard RRT algorithm, both in terms of computation of feasible solutions, and of computational complexity. In this paper, the RRT* algorithm is extended to deal with differential constraints. A sufficient condition for asymptotic optimality is provided. It is shown that the RRT* algorithm equipped with any local steering procedure that satisfies this condition converges to an optimal solution almost surely. In particular, simple local steering procedures are provided for a Dubins' vehicle as well as a double integrator. Simulation examples are also provided for these systems comparing the RRT and the RRT* algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new algorithm for optimal path planning subject to terrain avoidance constraints. The new method extends an existing approach based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to offer significant improvements in computational efficiency, while guaranteeing globally optimal solution of the path-planning problem. This improvement is the result of three key enhancements. First, the terrain representation is reformulated as a piecewise affine function, resulting in a better conditioned MILP problem. Second, an efficient method of approximating and simplifying real terrain data is developed. Finally, an iterative MILP solution approach is adopted, reducing computational effort by avoiding the application of redundant constraints. The new method is shown to offer significant reductions in solution time for only small loss of performance in terms of the planning objective.},

A weighted extension of the classical Fermat point problem is used to develop a scalable methodology for the formation routing problem, enabling quick calculation of formation costs. This rapid evaluation allows the large-scale fleet assignment problem to be solved via a mixed integer linear program in reasonable time. Weighting schemes for aircraft performance characteristics are first introduced and then extended to allow for differential rates of fuel burn. Finally, a case study for 210 transatlantic flight routes is presented, with results showing possible average fuel-burn savings against solo flight of around 8.7% for formations of two and 13.1% for formations of up to three.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a deep and useful connection between statistical mechanics (the behavior of systems with many degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium at a finite temperature) and multivariate or combinatorial optimization (finding the minimum of a given function depending on many parameters). A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new distributed robust Model Predictive Control algorithm for multi-vehicle trajectory optimization and demonstrates the approach with numerical simulations and multi-vehicle experiments. The technique builds on the robust-safe-but-knowledgeable (RSBK) algorithm, which is developed in this paper for the multi-vehicle case. RSBK uses constraint tightening to achieve robustness to external disturbances, an invariant set to ensure safety in the presence of changes to the environment, and a cost-to-go function to generate an intelligent trajectory around known obstacles. The key advantage of this RSBK algorithm is that it enables the use of much shorter planning horizons while still preserving the robust feasibility guarantees of previously proposed approaches. The second contribution of this paper is a distributed version of the RSBK algorithm, which is more suitable for real-time execution. In the distributed RSBK (DRSBK) algorithm, each vehicle only optimizes for its own decisions by solving a subproblem of reduced size, which results in shorter computation times. Furthermore, the algorithm retains the robust feasibility guarantees of the centralized approach while requiring that each agent only have local knowledge of the environment and neighbor vehicles? plans. This new approach also facilitates the use of a significantly more general implementation architecture for the distributed trajectory optimization, which further decreases the delay due to computation time.},

  Abstract                 = {In this note, we investigate the stability of hybrid systems in closed-loop with model predictive controllers (MPC). A priori sufficient conditions for Lyapunov asymptotic stability and exponential stability are derived in the terminal cost and constraint set fashion, while allowing for discontinuous system dynamics and discontinuous MPC value functions. For constrained piecewise affine (PWA) systems as prediction models, we present novel techniques for computing a terminal cost and a terminal constraint set that satisfy the developed stabilization conditions. For quadratic MPC costs, these conditions translate into a linear matrix inequality while, for MPC costs based on 1, infin-norms, they are obtained as norm inequalities. New ways for calculating low complexity piecewise polyhedral positively invariant sets for PWA systems are also presented. An example illustrates the developed theory},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a form of MPC in which the control variables are moved asynchronously. This contrasts with most MIMO control schemes, which assume that all variables are updated simultaneously. MPC outperforms other control strategies through its ability to deal with constraints. This requires on-line optimization, hence computational complexity can become an issue when applying MPC to complex systems with fast response times. The Multiplexed MPC (MMPC) scheme described in this paper solves the MPC problem for each subsystem sequentially, and updates subsystem controls as soon as the solution is available, thus distributing the control moves over a complete update cycle. The resulting computational speed-up allows faster response to disturbances, which may result in improved performance, despite finding sub-optimal solutions to the original problem. This paper describes nominal and robust MMPC, states some stability results, and demonstrates the effectiveness of MMPC through two examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant attention in recent years. Low-cost platforms using inexpensive sensor payloads have been shown to provide satisfactory flight and navigation capabilities. In this report, we survey vision and control methods that can be applied to low-cost UAVs, and we list some popular inexpensive platforms and application fields where they are useful. We also highlight the sensor suites used where this information is available. We overview, among others, feature detection and tracking, optical flow and visual servoing, low-level stabilization and high-level planning methods. We then list popular low-cost UAVs, selecting mainly quadrotors. We discuss applications, restricting our focus to the field of infrastructure inspection. Finally, as an example, we formulate two use-cases for railway inspection, a less explored application field, and illustrate the usage of the vision and control techniques reviewed by selecting appropriate ones to tackle these use-cases. To select vision methods, we run a thorough set of experimental evaluations.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Autonomous navigation of a robot is a promising research domain due to its extensive applications. The navigation consists of four essential requirements known as perception, localization, cognition and path planning, and motion control in which path planning is the most important and interesting part. The proposed path planning techniques are classified into two main categories: classical methods and heuristic methods. The classical methods consist of cell decomposition, potential field method, subgoal network and road map. The approaches are simple; however, they commonly consume expensive computation and may possibly fail when the robot confronts with uncertainty. This survey concentrates on heuristic-based algorithms in robot path planning which are comprised of neural network, fuzzy logic, nature-inspired algorithms and hybrid algorithms. In addition, potential field method is also considered due to the good results. The strengths and drawbacks of each algorithm are discussed and future outline is provided.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an alternative approach to the problem of outdoor, persistent visual localisation against a known map. Instead of blindly applying a feature detector/descriptor combination over all images of all places, we leverage prior experiences of a place to learn place-dependent feature detectors (i.e., features that are unique to each place in our map and used for localisation). Furthermore, as these features do not represent low-level structure, like edges or corners, but are in fact mid-level patches representing distinctive visual elements (e.g., windows, buildings, or silhouettes), we are able to localise across extreme appearance changes. Note that there is no requirement that the features posses semantic meaning, only that they are optimal for the task of localisation. This work is an extension on previous work (McManus et al. in Proceedings of robotics science and systems, 2014b) in the following ways: (i) we have included a landmark refinement and outlier rejection step during the learning phase, (ii) we have implemented an asynchronous pipeline design, (iii) we have tested on data collected in an urban environment, and (iv) we have implemented a purely monocular system. Using over 100km worth of data for training, we present localisation results from Begbroke Science Park and central Oxford.},

  Abstract                 = {A Kalman filter requires an exact knowledge of the process noise covariance matrixQand the measurement noise covariance matrixR. Here we consider the case in which the true values ofQandRare unknown. The system is assumed to be constant, and the random inputs are stationary. First, a correlation test is given which checks whether a particular Kalman filter is working optimally or not. If the filter is suboptimal, a technique is given to obtain asymptotically normal, unbiased, and consistent estimates ofQandR. This technique works only for the case in which the form ofQis known and the number of unknown elements inQis less thann times rwherenis the dimension of the state vector andris the dimension of the measurement vector. For other cases, the optimal steady-state gain Kopis obtained directly by an iterative procedure without identifyingQ. As a corollary, it is shown that the steady-state optimal Kalman filter gain Kopdepends only onn times rlinear functionals ofQ. The results are first derived for discrete systems. They are then extended to continuous systems. A numerical example is given to show the usefulness of the approach.},

We focus on the development of a family of trajectories defined as a sequence of segments, each with a controller parameterized by a goal state or region in state space. Each controller is developed from the dynamic model of the robot and then iteratively refined through successive experimental trials in an automated fashion to account for errors in the dynamic model and noise in the actuators and sensors. We show that this approach permits the development of trajectories and controllers enabling such aggressive maneuvers as flying through narrow, vertical gaps and perching on inverted surfaces with high precision and repeatability.},

  Abstract                 = {Normative systems (norms) have been widely proposed as a technique for coordinating
multi-agent systems. The automated synthesis of norms for coordination remains an
open and complex problem, which we tackle in this paper. We propose a novel mechanism
called IRON (Intelligent Robust On-line Norm synthesis mechanism), for the on-line
synthesis of norms. IRON aims to synthesise conflict-free norms without lapsing into
over-regulation. Thus, IRON produces norms that characterise necessary conditions
for coordination, without over-regulation. In addition to defining the norm synthesis
problem formally, we empirically show that IRON is capable of synthesising norms that
are effective even in the presence of non-compliance behaviours in a system.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a receding horizon control strategy to enable small unmanned air vehicles to fly autonomously through complex urban environments. An adaptive, multiresolution-based learning algorithm is employed to estimate the 3D geometry of the environment. This learning algorithm generates an adaptive approximation based on measurements of the 3D positions of static points in the environment, obtained via feature point tracking and structure from motion. A receding horizon path planning strategy is used to select a series of locally-optimal path points in front of the vehicle. These path points are selected in such a manner that the vehicle approaches an overall target point while avoiding static obstacles that may lie in its path. These obstacles are estimated via the adaptive learning algorithm, which provides constraints for the path planner. A standard waypoint controller is then used to fly the vehicle through the selected path points. This vision-based control strategy is demonstrated in simulations of a small UAV flying through a virtual urban environment},

  Abstract                 = {Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS – a.k.a. drones) have evolved over the past decade as both advanced military technology and off-the-shelf consumer devices. There is a gradual shift towards public use of drones, which presents opportunities for effective remote procedures that can disrupt a variety of built environment disciplines. UAS equipment with remote sensing gear present an opportunity for analysis and inspection of existing building stocks, where architects, engineers, building energy auditors as well as owners can document building performance, visualize heat transfer using infrared imaging and create digital models using 3D photogrammetry. This paper presents a comprehensive review of various literature that addresses this topic, followed by the identification of a standard procedures for operating a UAS for energy audit missions. The presented framework is then tested on the Syracuse University campus site based on the literature review to showcase: 1) pre-flight inspection procedure parameters and methodologies; 2) during-flight visually identified areas of thermal anomalies using a UAS equipped with Infrared (IR) cameras and; 3) 3D CAD modeling developed through data gathered using UAS. A discussion of the findings suggests refining procedure accuracy through further empirical experimentation, as well as study replication, as a step towards standardizing the automation of building envelope inspection.},

The method relies on the Kreisselmeier?Steinhauser function to provide a smooth approximation of the penalty function for a soft constraint. This is analogous to the approximation of a hard constraint by a smooth logarithmic barrier function. By introducing this approximation directly into the objective of an interior point optimization, there is no need for additional slack variables to capture constraint violation. Simulation results show significant speed-up compared to using slack variables.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new analysis tool for predicting the closed-loop performance of a robust constrained Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme. Currently, performance is typically evaluated by numerical simulation, leading to extensive computation when investigating the effect of controller parameters, such as horizon length, cost weightings, and constraint settings. The method in this paper avoids this computational burden, enabling a rapid study of the trades between the design parameters and performance. Previous work developed an MPC scheme employing constraint tightening to achieve robust feasibility and constraint satisfaction despite the action of an unknown but bounded disturbance. This paper shows that the expected performance of that scheme can be predicted using a combination of the gains of two linear systems, the optimal control for the unconstrained system, and a candidate policy used in performing the constraint tightening. The method also accounts for possible mismatch between the predicted level of disturbance and the actual level encountered. The predictions are compared with simulation results for several examples.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper gives an overview of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and its relevance to Moving Autonomy Forward. MPC unifies planning and feedback control by employing online re-planning to respond to new information. The advantage for autonomy is that the planning process embedded within MPC can incorporate complex decision-making, such as task assignment, trajectory generation and other constrained optimization problems. Future autonomous systems will operate in dynamic, uncertain environments and must be able to revisit decisions in real time. MPC provides a framework for considering the resulting properties of such systems, including fundamental ones such as stability and robustness. The paper begins by describing the most general form of MPC and established results for stability and robustness. Recent extensions to hybrid systems incorporating logic and discrete decisions are also presented. The remainder of the paper presents various results from recent research applying MPC to emerging applications in autonomy. In particular, we consider vehicle guidance in complex environments, hybrid (i.e. mixed continuous and discrete) decision making and distributed MPC for cooperative control of teams. Initial implementations of MPC for autonomy in hardware are also reviewed.},

The method uses receding-horizon maximization of the miss distance, generating waypoints for a lower-level controller to follow. A key feature is the inclusion of the loitering circle limits as constraints in the problem: while this limits the flexibility for avoidance, it greatly improves the predictability of behaviour. An alternative ?Smart Corridor? form is also presented, used for avoidance while traveling along a predefined route. It is envisaged that this approach is consistent with integration into a UAV system and other elements of a ?layered approach? to the sense-and-avoid problem.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis extends Model Predictive Control (MPC) for constrained linear systems subject to uncertainty, including persistent disturbances, estimation error and the effects of delay. Previous work has shown that feasibility and constraint satisfaction can be guaranteed by tightening the constraints in a suitable, monotonic sequence. This thesis extends that work in several ways, including more flexible constraint tightening, applied within the prediction horizon, and more general terminal constraints, applied to ensure feasible evolution beyond the horizon. These modifications reduce the conservatism associated with the constraint tightening approach. Modifications to account for estimation error, enabling output feedback control, are presented, and we show that the effects of time delay can be handled in a similar manner. A further extension combines robust MPC with a novel uncertainty estimation algorithm, providing an adaptive MPC that adjusts the optimization constraints to suit the level of uncertainty detected. This adaptive control replaces the need for accurate \emph{a~priori} knowledge of uncertainty bounds. An approximate algorithm is developed for the prediction of the closed-loop performance using the new robust MPC formulation, enabling rapid trade studies on the effect of controller parameters. The constraint tightening concept is applied to develop a novel algorithm for Decentralized MPC~(DMPC) for teams of cooperating subsystems with coupled constraints. The centralized MPC optimization is divided into smaller subproblems, each solving for the future actions of a single subsystem. Each subproblem is solved only once per time step, without iteration, and is guaranteed to be feasible. Simulation examples involving multiple Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles~({UAV}s) demonstrate that the new DMPC algorithm offers significant computational improvement compared to its centralized counterpart. The controllers developed in this thesis are demonstrated throughout in simulated examples related to vehicle control. Also, some of the controllers have been implemented on vehicle testbeds to verify their operation. The tools developed in this thesis improve the applicability of MPC to problems involving uncertainty and high complexity, for example, the control of a team of cooperating {UAV}s.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis presents methods for finding optimal trajectories for vehicles subjected to avoidance and assignment requirements. The former include avoidance of collisions with obstacles or other vehicles and avoidance of thruster plumes from spacecraft. Assignment refers to the inclusion of decisions about terminal constraints in the optimization, such as assignment of waypoints to {UAV}s and the assignment of spacecraft to positions in a formation. These requirements lead to non-convex constraints and difficult optimizations. However, they can be formulated as \emph{mixed-integer linear programs} (MILP) that can be solved for global optimality using powerful, commercial software. This thesis provides several extensions to previous work using MILP. The constraints for avoidance are extended to prevent \emph{plume impingement}, which occurs when one spacecraft fire thrusters towards another. Methods are presented for efficient simplifications to complex problems, allowing solutions to be obtained in practical computation times. An approximation is developed to enable the inclusion of aircraft dynamics in a linear optimization, and also to include a general form of waypoint assignment suitable for {UAV} problems. Finally, these optimizations are used in \emph{model predictive control}, running in real-time to incorporate feedback and compensate for uncertainty. Two major application areas are considered: spacecraft and aircraft. Spacecraft problems involve minimum fuel optimizations, and include ISS rendezvous and satellite cluster configuration. Aircraft problems are solved for minimum flight-time, or in the case of {UAV} problems with assignment, waypoint values and vehicle capabilities are included. Aircraft applications include air traffic management and coordination of autonomous {UAV}s. The results in this thesis provide a direct route to globally-optimal solutions of these non-convex trajectory optimizations.},

Two methods are compared for solving the optimization that combines task assignment, subjected to {UAV} capability constraints, and path planning, subjected to dynamics, avoidance and timing constraints. Both sub-problems are non-convex and the two are strongly-coupled. The first method expresses the entire problem as a single mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that can be solved using available software. This method is guaranteed to find the globally-optimal solution to the problem, but is computationally intensive. The second method employs an approximation for rapid computation of the cost of many different trajectories. This enables the assignment and trajectory problems to be decoupled and partially distributed, offering much faster computation. The paper presents several examples to compare the performance and computational results from these two algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new analysis tool for predicting the closed-loop performance of a robust constrained Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme. Currently, performance is typically evaluated by numerical simulation, leading to extensive computation when investigating the effect of controller parameters, such as horizon length, cost weightings, and constraint settings. The analytic method in this paper avoids this computational burden, enabling a rapid study of the trades between the design parameters and performance. Previous work developed an MPC formulation employing constraint tightening to achieve robust feasibility and constraint satisfaction despite the action of an unknown but bounded disturbance. This paper shows that the expected performance of that controller can be predicted using a combination of the gains of two linear systems, the optimal control for the unconstrained system, and a candidate policy used in performing the constraint tightening. The method also accounts for possible mismatch between the predicted level of disturbance and the actual level encountered. The analytic results are compared with simulation results for several examples and are shown to provide accurate predictions of performance and its variation with system parameters.},

The new method extends the <i>constraint tightening</i> approach to robust Model Predictive Control of constrained linear systems by combining it with a \emph{variable horizon}. This relaxes the requirement for the target to be an invariant set, which is assumed by many stabilizing MPC formulations but can be restrictive in vehicle maneuvering applications. The target sets for vehicle maneuvers are typically determined by the mission requirements and are not generally invariant sets. The new controller guarantees finite-time arrival within an arbitrary target set, \emph{i.e.}~not necessarily invariant, and is therefore applicable when the target is predetermined by other factors. Several simulation examples are presented including spacecraft rendezvous control with sensor visibility constraints and {UAV} guidance through obstacle fields.},

As an example, a simple estimator is proposed and analyzed to provide the necessary error bounds. Furthermore, it is shown that delayed state information can be handled using the same method. These analyses depend on knowledge of bounds on the measurement and disturbance uncertainties. The second extension provides a method of estimating these bounds using available data, providing an adaptive form of the controller for cases where the error levels are poorly known <i>a priori</i>.},

The problem involves vehicles with independent dynamics but with coupled constraints to capture required cooperative behavior.

Collision avoidance is used as an example of coupled constraints and the paper shows how the speed, turn rate and avoidance distance limits in the optimization should be modified in order to guarantee robust constraint satisfaction. Integer programming is used to solve the non-convex problem of path-planning subject to avoidance constraints. Numerical simulations compare computation time and target arrival time under decentralized and centralized control and investigate the impact of decentralization on team performance. The results show that the computation required for DMPC is significantly lower than for its centralized counterpart and scales better with the size of the team, at the expense of only a small increase in {UAV} flight times.},

  Abstract                 = {With the advent of new, low-cost 3D sensing hardware such as the Kinect, and continued efforts in advanced point cloud processing, 3D perception gains more and more importance in robotics, as well as other fields. In this paper we present one of our most recent initiatives in the areas of point cloud perception: PCL (Point Cloud Library - http://pointclouds.org). PCL presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of 3D perception, and it's meant to provide support for all the common 3D building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of-the art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. PCL is supported by an international community of robotics and perception researchers. We provide a brief walkthrough of PCL including its algorithmic capabilities and implementation strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization-based control strategy that is considered extremely attractive in the autonomous space rendezvous scenarios. The ORCSAT study addresses its applicability in Mars Sample Return mission, including the implementation of the developed solution in a space representative avionic architecture system. With respect to a classical control solution (HARVD), MPC allows a significant performance improvement both in trajectory and in propellant save. Furthermore, thanks to the on-line optimization, it allows to identify improvements in other areas (i.e.at mission definition level) that could not be known a-priori.},

  Abstract                 = {Autonomous exploration of subterranean environments constitutes a major frontier for robotic systems as underground settings present key challenges that can render robot autonomy hard to achieve. This has motivated the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, where teams of robots search for objects of interest in various underground environments. In response, the CERBERUS system-of-systems is presented as a unified strategy towards subterranean exploration using legged and flying robots. As primary robots, ANYmal quadruped systems are deployed considering their endurance and potential to traverse challenging terrain. For aerial robots, both conventional and collision-tolerant multirotors are utilized to explore spaces too narrow or otherwise unreachable by ground systems. Anticipating degraded sensing conditions, a complementary multi-modal sensor fusion approach utilizing camera, LiDAR, and inertial data for resilient robot pose estimation is proposed. Individual robot pose estimates are refined by a centralized multi-robot map optimization approach to improve the reported location accuracy of detected objects of interest in the DARPA-defined coordinate frame. Furthermore, a unified exploration path planning policy is presented to facilitate the autonomous operation of both legged and aerial robots in complex underground networks. Finally, to enable communication between the robots and the base station, CERBERUS utilizes a ground rover with a high-gain antenna and an optical fiber connection to the base station, alongside breadcrumbing of wireless nodes by our legged robots. We report results from the CERBERUS system-of-systems deployment at the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Tunnel and Urban Circuits, along with the current limitations and the lessons learned for the benefit of the community.},

In the new algorithm, for linear, dynamically-decoupled subsystems in the presence of bounded disturbances, an optimizing subsystem determines the existence of paths in a graph representing currently-active coupling constraints. Where such paths exists, cooperation is promoted by the local agent designing a hypothetical plan for other subsystems. Robust feasibility and stability are maintained by permitting only non-coupled agents to update at each time step. By simulation, performance is shown to surpass that of using cooperation between immediately-adjacent agents, rivalling that of a ?fully cooperative? implementation.},

The new method offers greater flexibility in communications than existing robust methods, and relaxes restrictions on the order in which distributed computations are performed. The local controllers use the concept of tube MPC ? in which an optimisation designs a tube for the system to follow rather than a trajectory ? to achieve robust feasibility and stability despite the presence of persistent, bounded disturbances. A methodical exploration of the trades between performance and communication is provided by numerical simulations of an example scenario. It is shown that at low levels of inter-agent communication, distributed MPC can obtain a lower closed-loop cost than that obtained by a centralised implementation. A further example shows that the flexibility in communications means the new algorithm has a relatively low susceptibility to the adverse effects of delays in computation and communication.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The idea of a Cloned Controller to approximate optimised control algorithms in a real-time environment is introduced. A Cloned Controller is demonstrated using Linguistic Decision Trees (LDTs) to clone a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning through a hostile environment. Modifications to the \{LDT\} algorithm are proposed to account for attributes with circular domains, such as bearings, and discontinuous output functions. The cloned controller is shown to produce near optimal paths whilst significantly reducing the decision period. Further investigation shows that the cloned controller generalises to the multi-obstacle case although this can lead to situations far outside of the training dataset and consequently result in decisions with a high level of uncertainty. A modification to the algorithm to improve the performance in regions of high uncertainty is proposed and shown to further enhance generalisation. The resulting controller combines the high performance of MPC?MILP with the rapid response of an \{LDT\} while providing a degree of transparency/interpretability of the decision making.},

A method to predict a discontinuous function with fuzzy decision trees is proposed and shown to make a good approximation to the optimisation behaviour with significantly reduced computational expense. Decision trees are shown to generalise to new scenarios of greater complexity than those represented in the training data and to make decisions on a time scale that would enable implementation in a real-time system. It is also demonstrated that the transparency of the rule based approach is useful in understanding the behaviour exhibited by the controller.

  Abstract                 = {The article presents a random neural Q-learning strategy for the obstacle avoidance problem of an autonomous mobile robot in unknown environments. In the proposed strategy, two independent modules, namely, avoidance without considering the target and goal-seeking without considering obstacles, are first trained using the proposed random neural Q-learning algorithm to obtain their best control policies. Then, the two trained modules are combined based on a switching function to realize the obstacle avoidance in unknown environments. For the proposed random neural Q-learning algorithm, a single-hidden layer feedforward network is used to approximate the Q-function to estimate the Q-value. The parameters of the single-hidden layer feedforward network are modified using the recently proposed neural algorithm named the online sequential version of extreme learning machine, where the parameters of the hidden nodes are assigned randomly and the sample data can come one by one. However, different from the original online sequential version of extreme learning machine algorithm, the initial output weights are estimated subjected to quadratic inequality constraint to improve the convergence speed. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed random neural Q-learning strategy can successfully solve the obstacle avoidance problem. Also, the higher learning efficiency and better generalization ability are achieved by the proposed random neural Q-learning algorithm compared with the Q-learning based on the back-propagation method.},

automated robot; remote-controlled robot; semi-autonomous robot, teleoperated robot

robot: An agentive device (Agent and Device in SUMO) in a broad sense, purposed to act in the physical
world in order to accomplish one or more tasks. In some cases, the actions of a robot might be subordinated
to actions of other agents (Agent in SUMO), such as software agents (bots) or humans. A robot is
composed of suitable mechanical and electronic parts. Robots might form social groups, where they
interact to achieve a common goal. A robot (or a group of robots) can form robotic systems together with
special environments geared to facilitate their work. See also: automated robot; fully autonomous robot;
remote-controlled robot; robot group; robotic system; semi-autonomous robot; teleoperated robot.},
